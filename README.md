# Better First Issues

Allows Developers to better look for, and select their first open source
contribution. You can also use this tool to just look for random repositories
or issues that might fancy you.

Visit the tool [here](http://better-first-issues.vercel.app/).

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push.

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - I use Node v16.6.2 but really
  anything 12+ should work.

### Installing

Clone this repository to your machine and run

```bash
npm install
```

To start up the dev server, run this:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Running the tests

We have no tests :(

### Sample Tests

We'd like to add test cases. Check out the [issues](issues) to learn more.

### Style test

Check if the best practices and the right coding style has been used.
Run an ```npm run lint``` to see if there's any styling errors.
Also run ```npm run lint:fix``` to fix issues that can be auto-fixed.

Note that the build process will fail if there are lint issues.

## Deployment

NextJS works a bit differently to other JS dev-build cycles.
To prepare for deployment, run this command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This compiles and bundles the code into the **.next** folder.
After this is done, run this command to start the production server.

```bash
npm run start
```
